          manner described in this clause 7.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          7.2 Contributions to be made in ETH must be sent from your wallet used
          for signing in on our website in respect of which you can identify
          your private key. Your wallet will be required to verify your ETH
          contribution to the Company and to enable the Company to issue PSY to
          you through the Smart Contract System (as further described in clause
          8). ETH contributions must be sent to the Company’s respective wallet
          address specified on the website https://token.PSY.com/. You must have
          enough funds in your wallet for the payment, gas and transaction fee
          prior to participating in the Token Sale.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          7.3 Contributions must be sent to the Company’s wallet addresses, as
          described in clause 7.2. To the extent that any third-party website,
          service or smart-contract offers to receive contributions and issues
          PSY or facilitates the allocation or transfer of PSY in any way during
          the Token Sale, such third-party websites or services are, unless
          expressly set out in these T&Cs or mentioned on the PSY Website, not
          authorised by the Company nor do they have any legal or commercial
          relationship in any way with the Company, the PsyDAO Commons or PSY.
        </Text>
        <Text>7.4 Contributors that send contributions:</Text>
        <Text>{`a) in (i) any crypto-currency other than ETH or (ii) a manner that does not otherwise conform with the methods of contribution described in these T&Cs; or`}</Text>
        <Text>{`b) b) to any third-party website, wallet address, bank account, service or smart contract that offers PSY in the manner described in this clause 7; risk losing their entire contribution. The Company will not be responsible or liable for recovering or returning any such contributions to the Contributor, nor will the Company be responsible or liable for any losses incurred by the Contributor in this respect.`}</Text>

          8. Creation and issue of PSY through the Smart Contract System
        </Text>
        <Text>
          8.1 The Company has deployed a smart contract system (the “Smart
          Contract System”) on the Ethereum blockchain for the purposes of
          creating PSY and issuing such PSY to the Contributor’s Ethereum
          wallet. PSY will be based on the ERC20 token standard and is intended
          to have the utility set out in the PsyDAO Whitepaper.
        </Text>
        <Text>8.2 The Company will keep a record of:</Text>

        <Text>{`a) all ETH contributions received by the Company’s wallet;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`b) the time the contribution was received;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`c) the amount of the contribution; and`}</Text>
        <Text>{`d) the wallet address from which the contribution was sent (as the case may be), (“Contribution Records”).`}</Text>
        <Text>
          8.3 In order to receive PSY, Contributors must have and must notify
          the Company in accordance with the procedures specified by the Company
          on the PSY Website of the address of an Ethereum wallet that supports
          the ERC20 token standard. In other words, the Contributor’s Ethereum
          wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with
          the receipt, storage and transfer of PSY, being tokens that are
          created based on the ERC20 token standard. The Company reserves the
          right to prescribe additional conditions relating to specific wallet
          requirements at any time acting in its sole and absolute discretion.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          8.4 Immediately following your contribution, the Company will
          undertake an automated contribution verification procedure by
          reference to the Contribution Records. Subject to clause 6, provided
          the Company is successfully able to verify your contribution, the
          Company will send instructions to the Smart Contract System to
          initiate the creation and issue of PSY to the Ethereum wallet address
          which you send us automated notice of through the Smart Contract
          System pursuant to clause 8.3.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          8.5 Subject to compliance with clauses 6, 7 and 8, the Smart Contract
          System will distribute the applicable number of PSY to the Ethereum
          wallet address notified to it under clause 8.3, upon confirmation by
          the Company of its receipt of the relevant contribution in accordance
          with these T&Cs. The unlocking of transferability of PSY occurs after
          the completion of the Token Sale.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          8.6 Without limiting the grounds upon which the Company may refuse to
          distribute tokens, if distribution of PSY to you, or the holding of
          PSY by you, is or becomes impossible or a violation of any applicable
          legal or regulatory requirements, or the Company suspects this may be
          the case, then: a) the Company need not distribute any PSY or return
          any contribution or its equivalent to you nor, in either case, to any
          other person or entity; b) the Company may request, require or
          facilitate steps to be taken to ensure the full return of any PSY that
          you hold; c) the Company reserves the right to terminate its
          relationship with you and take any actions considered necessary or
          desirable for the Company to meet its legal and regulatory
          obligations; and d) such actions will be irrespective of any
          contribution that has been made by you to the Company and/or any other
          third party, and the Company is not required to provide reasons.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          8.7 On initial distribution during the sale, PSY will be inactive
          (which means they are not transferable) and must be activated by the
          Company at the conclusion of the sale in order to be transferable to
          any third party in accordance with clause 9.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          8.8 On receipt of your contribution, such contribution will
          immediately become the sole and exclusive property of the Company,
          which will be entitled to apply the contribution towards the operating
          expenses relating to the business of any entity within the PsyDAO
          Group to which the Company belongs. The application of your
          contribution will be determined by us acting in our sole and absolute
          discretion and we are not under any obligation to inform you or
          otherwise verify how your contribution is used.

        <Text>
          9.2 PSY that are purchased by you may be claimed by you only. PSY are
          not transferable to any blockchain address prior to activation. Prior
          to activation of any PSY, you cannot transfer nor attempt to transfer
          (whether by assignment, trust, charge, sub-contract, novation or
          otherwise), PSY or any part or the whole of your rights, title or
          interest under these T&Cs, including your right to claim those PSY, to
          any other person or entity, whether with or without consideration. All
          such transfers and attempted transfers are strictly prohibited, will

          out in these T&Cs.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          9.4 After activation, you may transfer to another wallet or address
          any PSY which you lawfully hold. Such transfer will be deemed
          effective, and a transfer of any PSY will only be effective, as at the
          time and date of the relevant transaction being included in a block on
          the Ethereum blockchain which has received such number of
          confirmations as the Company considers necessary for that transaction
          to be considered irreversible.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          9.5 If you transfer PSY to a wallet or address owned by another
          person, then that person and the owner of each other wallet or address
          to which that PSY is further transferred (each, “New Holder”) are each
          deemed to be bound by these T&Cs as Contributors for the period of
          time they hold such PSY, and you irrevocably and unconditionally
          undertake to ensure that each New Holder, prior to the transfer of PSY
          to them, expressly agrees to be bound by these T&Cs as a Contributor
          for the period of time they hold PSY.

          which you transfer that PSY.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          9.7 The owner of the wallet in which any PSY is held will (except as
          otherwise required by law or as ordered by a court of competent
          jurisdiction) be treated as the absolute owner of that PSY for all
          purposes (regardless of any notice of any trust or any other interest,
          or the theft or loss of any private key) and neither the Company nor
          any other person will be liable for so treating that person as
          absolute owner.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          9.8 The Company agrees that, if any rule of law (including any
          legislation, rule of common law, rule of equity or customary law)
          requires written notice to effect the transfer of any PSY, such notice
          is deemed given as an electronic record by inclusion of the relevant
          transaction on a block on the Ethereum blockchain in accordance with
          clause 9.4 above.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          9.9 Notwithstanding any other provision in this clause 9, the Company

          contributions made at any time in the Company’s sole and absolute
          discretion. To the extent that we refuse or reject a contribution, we
          will exercise reasonable endeavours to procure that the contribution
          is returned to the Contributor to the Ethereum wallet, or to the bank
          account from which the contribution was made (as the case may be),
          subject to clause 10.1. However, we do not warrant, represent or offer
          any assurances that we will successfully be able to recover and/or
          return any such contributions.

          10.3 Subject to clauses 10.1 and 10.2 and except to the extent
          required by applicable law, all contributions received by the Company

          claim any refund or reimbursement of contributions from the Company.

          10.4 At any time prior to satisfaction of the Completion Conditions,
          the Company may either temporarily suspend or permanently end the
          Token Sale in whole or part, and with respect to all or certain
          persons, at any time if:
        </Text>
        <Text>{`a) any change occurs to the Ethereum network, which in the Company’s opinion is likely to materially prejudice the success of the Token Sale or the development of the PsyDAO Commons in any respect;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`b) any change occurs to any local, national or international regulatory, financial, political or economic conditions, which in the Company’s opinion is likely to materially prejudice the success of the Token Sale or the PsyDAO Commons in any respect;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`c) with or without reasons, PsyDAO elects to cease support for the PsyDAO website or participation in the PsyDAO Commons;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`d) the Token Sale or the Company is required by any applicable law or regulation to be licensed or approved or fundamentally restructured;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`e) the Company is notified by any government, quasi-government, authority or public body (including any regulatory body of any jurisdiction) in any jurisdiction that the Token Sale or PsyDAO Commons is under investigation, or prohibited, banned or must cease, or the Company is otherwise required by law to end the Token Sale;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`f) the Token Sale is discontinued due to any force majeure event and the Company cannot reasonably expect the Token Sale to be resumed within 90 days;`}</Text>
        <Text>{`g) the Company considers there are security reasons for doing so; or`}</Text>
        <Text>{`h) with or without reasons, the Company elects to terminate the Token Sale.`}</Text>
        <Text>
          10.5 Any suspension, abortion or end of the Token Sale will be deemed
          to commence from the moment that the Company publishes a notice to
          that effect on the PSY Website.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          10.6 During any period of suspension or in the event that the Token
          Sale is ended, the Smart Contract System will no longer be able to
          receive and accept contributions, create PSY and/or issue PSY to
          Contributors. Contributors who send us contributions (after we publish
          a notice that the Token Sale has been suspended, aborted or ended in
          accordance with clause 10.5) risk losing their entire contribution and
          we will not be responsible or liable for recovering or returning any
          such contributions to the Contributor nor will we be responsible or
          liable for any losses incurred by such contributors in this respect.
          Contributors are therefore strongly advised to check the PSY Website
          before sending a contribution to the Smart Contract System.
