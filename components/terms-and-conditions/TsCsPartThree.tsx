        <Text fontWeight={600}>1. Risk of software weaknesses:</Text>
        <Text>
          Because PSY and the Smart Contract System are based on the Ethereum
          protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum
          protocol may have a material adverse effect on PSY, the Smart Contract
          System and/or the PsyDAO Commons. Moreover, advances in cryptography,
          or technical advances, such as the development of quantum computing,
          could present risks to PSY (including the utility of PSY for obtaining
          services), the Smart Contract System and/or the PsyDAO Commons, by
          rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that
          underpins the Ethereum protocol. The Smart Contract System concept,
          the underlying software application and software platform (i.e., the
          Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and
          unproven. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for
          creating PSY will be uninterrupted or error-free, and there is an
          inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses,
          vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete
          loss of contributions and/or PSY.

        <Text fontWeight={600}>2. Regulatory risk:</Text>
        <Text>
          Blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is
          possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations
          on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain
          technology-based applications, which may be contrary to the current
          setup of the Smart Contract System, and which may, inter alia, result
          in substantial modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the
          PsyDAO Commons, including its termination and the loss of PSY for the
          Contributor. Additionally, regulation of proposed activities of the
          PsyDAO Commons is currently uncertain. It is not known what regulatory
          framework the proposed PsyDAO Commons and associated activities will
          be subject to, the nature and obligations that will be imposed on the
          Company in order to comply with any such regulatory framework or
          when/if the Company will even be able to apply to be regulated, or
          successfully obtain the necessary licences so that it may lawfully
          carry out its proposed business activities.

          3. Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement
          actions:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The regulatory status of PSY and distributed ledger technology is
          unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict
          how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation
          with respect to such technology and its applications, including
          specifically (but without limitation to) the PsyDAO Commons and PSY.
          It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or
          regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation
          affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications,
          including specifically (but without limitation to) the PsyDAO Commons
          and PSY. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the PsyDAO
          Commons, PSY and/or the Company in various ways, including, for
          purposes of illustration only, through a determination that PSY are a
          regulated financial instrument that requires registration or
          licensing. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the
          event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make
          it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
          undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate
          in such jurisdiction.

          4. Risk of abandonment / lack of success / business failure:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The creation and issue of PSY and the development of the PsyDAO
          Commons may be abandoned, may suffer from lack of success and may
          suffer business failure for a number of reasons including, but not
          limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of
          commercial success or prospects (e.g., caused by competing projects).
          There is no assurance that, even if PsyDAO Commons is partially or
          fully developed and launched, you will receive any benefits through
          PSY that you hold.

          5. Risk associated with other applications:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The PsyDAO Commons may give rise to other, alternative projects,
          promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which PSY will have no
          intrinsic value. This means that competitors may produce platforms
          that compete with the PsyDAO Commons and may not accept PSY as payment
          for services within such platforms; further, such platforms may become
          more popular and have greater success than the PsyDAO Commons. In
          addition, the utility of PSY depends in part on the success of the
          PsyDAO Commons. The PsyDAO Commons may not be popular or widely used.
          In the long term, the PsyDAO Commons may fail to attract a critical
          mass of users. The PsyDAO Commons may be merged with other projects.
          Various circumstances, including technical advancement and
          competitors, may render the PsyDAO Commons obsolete.

      <Flex gap={1} direction={"column"} color={"#591D6D"}>
        <Text fontWeight={600}>6. Risks associated with markets for PSY:</Text>
        <Text>
          The Company may choose not to enable or otherwise facilitate any
          secondary speculative trading or any such external valuation of PSY.
          This may restrict the contemplated avenues for using PSY to the token
          utility described in the PSY Whitepaper and could therefore create
          illiquidity risk with respect to PSY you own. Even if secondary
          trading of PSY is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges
          may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory
          oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.
          Furthermore, to the extent that any third party ascribes an external
          exchange value to PSY (e.g., as denominated in a virtual or fiat
          currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.
          If you are purchasing PSY as a form of investment on a speculative
          basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation
          or desire that their inherent, intrinsic or cash-equivalent value may
          increase with time, you assume all risks associated with such
          speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and
          accept that PSY are not offered by the Company or its affiliates on an
          investment basis or for any investment purpose whatsoever. You further
          acknowledge that any contribution that you make under these T&Cs (or
          you consider to be invested in the Company) will not be protected,
          guaranteed or reimbursed by any governmental, regulatory or other
          entity.

          7. Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s),
          custodial error or your error:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          PSY can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a
          combination of the Contributor’s account information (address),
          private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a
          password. You acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private
          key or password gets lost or stolen, the obtained PSY associated with
          your Ethereum wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently
          lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private
          key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to
          your Ethereum wallet, may be able to misappropriate your PSY. Any
          errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital
          wallet or vault you choose to receive and store PSY, including your
          own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault,
          may also result in the loss of your PSY.

        <Text fontWeight={600}>8. Risk of theft and vulnerabilities:</Text>
        <Text>
          The Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application
          and software platform (i.e., the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed
          to attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but not limited
          to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based
          attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such successful
          attacks could result in theft or loss of contributions or PSY,
          adversely impacting the ability to develop the PsyDAO Commons and
          derive any usage or functionality from PSY. You must take appropriate
          steps to satisfy yourself of the integrity and veracity of relevant
          websites, systems and communications. Furthermore, because the PsyDAO
          Commons is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third
          party or a member of the Company’s or PsyDAO Group’s team may
          intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into
          the core infrastructure of the PsyDAO Commons, which could negatively
          affect the PsyDAO Commons and PSY.

        <Text fontWeight={600}>9. Risk of Ethereum mining attacks:</Text>
        <Text>
          As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart
          Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not
          limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks,
          “selfish-mining” attacks, and rare condition attacks. Any successful
          attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper
          execution and sequencing of token transactions, and expected proper
          execution and sequencing of contract computations.

        <Text fontWeight={600}>10. Risk of incompatible wallet service:</Text>
        <Text>
          The wallet or wallet service provider used to receive PSY must conform
          to the ERC20 token standard in order to be technically compatible with
          PSY. The failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that
          Contributor will not gain access to his PSY.

        <Text>
          The PsyDAO Commons will need to go through substantial development
          works as part of which it may become the subject of significant
          conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release of the
          PsyDAO Commons. As part of the development, an upgrade to PSY may be
          required (hard fork of PSY) and that, if you decide not to participate
          in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use your PSY and any
          non-upgraded PSY may lose its utility in full.

        <Text>
          Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions,
          PSY are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to
          insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value,
          there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to
          offer recourse to you.

        <Text>
          The tax characterization of PSY is uncertain. You must seek your own
          tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use
          of PSY, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you,
          including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes,

          Because PSY confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to
          the Company, all decisions involving the Company (including to sell or
          liquidate the Company) will be made by the Company acting in its sole
          and absolute discretion, and all decisions involving the PsyDAO
          Commons including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the
          PsyDAO Commons and to create and issue additional tokens beyond PSY,
          will be made by PsyDAO, except as expressly specified otherwise in the

        </Text>
        <Text>
          The cryptocurrency exchange market, the token listing and trading
          market, ICOs, and by extension the PsyDAO Commons, is subject to a
          variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations,
          including those with respect to KYC/AML and customer due diligence
          procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data
          security, and others. These laws and regulations, and the
          interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could
          change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting PSY and/or the
          PsyDAO Commons could be enacted, which could impact the utility of PSY
          in the PsyDAO Commons. Additionally, PsyDAO Commons users are subject
          to or may be adversely affected by industry specific laws and
          regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails
          to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable
          laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing

          PsyDAO Commons:
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The PsyDAO Commons may undergo significant changes over time. Although
          we intend for PSY and PsyDAO Commons to function as described in the
          PsyDAO Whitepaper and intend to take commercially reasonable steps
          towards those ends, we or PsyDAO may have to make changes to the
          specifications of PSY or the PsyDAO Commons for any number of
          legitimate reasons. Moreover, PsyDAO may not be able to retain full
          and effective control over how other participants will use the PsyDAO
          Commons, what products or services will be offered through the PsyDAO
          Commons by third parties, or how third-party products and services
          will utilise PSY (if at all). This could create the risk that PSY or
          PsyDAO Commons, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your
          expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite PsyDAO’s
          good faith efforts to develop and participate in the PsyDAO Commons,
          it is still possible that the PsyDAO Commons will experience
          malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or
